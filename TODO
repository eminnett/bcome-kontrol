==============
A scripted interactive mode? let user define list of machine to add... programatically.
I.e. an interface onto adding selections, and then a simple hook to load in interactive mode. (i.e. boot into mode with seed file stating selections - kind of like a static manifest)
A new kind of sub-select that unions two or more other inventories where SSH connection details come from each origin inventory, this will allow us to union inventories across disparate DCs
Drivers for other platforms: digital ocean / azure / rackspace etc
