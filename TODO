Backlog v 1.4
==============
* The ability to create static manifests

* Network drivers for other platforms in this order: GCP, Azure, Digital Ocean, Rackspace

* Generators for orchestration scripts

* A scripted interactive mode? let user define list of machine to add... programatically.
I.e. an interface onto adding selections, and then a simple hook to load in interactive mode. (i.e. boot into mode with seed file stating selections - kind of like a static manifest)

* A new inventory sub-select that unions two or more other inventories merging together machines from entirely disparate networks, this will allow us to union inventories across disparate clouds/dcs/whatever
